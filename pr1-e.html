<h1>What is Python ?</h1>
<p>
Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together
<br>
</p>
<h1>Why Python?</h1>
<p>
Python runs on various platforms (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc.).
</p>
<p>
The python language is one of the most accessible programming languages available because it has simplified syntax and not complicated, which gives more emphasis on natural
language.<br> Due to its ease of learning and usage, python codes can be easily written and executed much faster than other programming languages.
<h1>What is a Python File?</h1>
<p>
A PY file is a program file or script written in Python, an interpreted object-oriented programming language.
<br>
It can be created and edited with a text editor, but requires a Python interpreter to run.
<br>
PY files are often used for programming web servers and other administrative computer systems.
